# Modal Exercise ✨

This repository contains a **Modal** project developed as part of my training. The objective of this exercise was to create a simple modal popup using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Overview 📋

The modal is a UI element that appears on top of the main content, typically used for messages, forms, or additional interactions. In this project, the modal is triggered by a button click and can be closed in multiple ways for improved user experience.

## Features 🌟

- **Open the Modal**: Clicking a button displays the modal in the center of the page.
- **Close the Modal**:
  - By clicking the "X" button at the top-right corner of the modal.
  - By clicking outside the modal (on the overlay).
- **Dark Overlay**: The rest of the page is dimmed with a semi-transparent overlay.
- **Scroll Lock**: Scrolling is disabled when the modal is open.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Why This Project? 🤔

This project was designed to introduce and reinforce essential web development concepts, including:

- **Overlay and Z-Index**: Creating a semi-transparent background overlay using CSS.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Adding and removing event listeners in JavaScript.
- **User Interaction**: Handling clicks inside and outside the modal for closing functionality.
- **Scroll Lock**: Temporarily disabling page scrolling while the modal is active.

These are fundamental skills that can be applied to numerous web development scenarios, from basic UI components to complex, dynamic applications.
